# Product Brief — Leader Influence Dashboard

## Executive Summary

Influence on Sway is defined as a leader’s ability to mobilize a verified bloc of voters in specific elections where margins are tight. This dashboard surfaces how much influence a leader has, where that influence is located, how it is changing over time, and how it propagates through their network.

The goal is to help leaders understand where their political power is real today — and where targeted growth could meaningfully increase it.

## What Does “Influence” Mean on Sway?

Influence is having a credible voter bloc.

When a group of registered voters coordinate around a candidate or measure, they form a unit of power that can affect election outcomes. The significance of that power depends not only on how many voters are aligned, but _where_ they are aligned relative to the size and competitiveness of specific elections.

A leader’s network translates into political power through three layers:

1. **Verified Reach**
   Supporters who are registered voters in specific jurisdictions — not just followers, but ballot-holding constituents.

2. **Electoral Concentration**
   Density of supporters within specific races or jurisdictions. For example, 100 voters in a local school board race may outweigh 1,000 voters spread across congressional districts.

3. **Network Amplification**
   Supporters who become leaders themselves, extending the movement’s reach organically.

The core insight is that understanding _where_ influence exists is as important as knowing _how much_ influence exists.

## Core Metrics (MVP)

### 1. Sway Score

**Definition:** Total number of verified voters aligned with the leader.
**Why it matters:** This is the core currency of influence and the most legible signal to external stakeholders.

---

### 2. Electoral Influence by Upcoming Elections or by Jurisdiction

**Definition:** Supporter counts grouped by upcoming elections or by jurisdiction, contextualized by where influence can be exercised soon.
**Why it matters:** Influence is situational — the same number of voters can be decisive in one election and negligible in another.

This metric captures both _where_ influence exists and _how meaningful_ it may be, without attempting precise outcome prediction.

---

### 3. Growth Over Time

**Definition:** Change in Sway Score over time.
**Why it matters:** Momentum signals whether a movement is accelerating, plateauing, or declining.

---

### 4. Network Reach

**Definition:** Supporters who have become leaders themselves, along with their downstream reach.
**Why it matters:** This captures the compounding effect of influence through organic network growth.

## What’s Out of Scope (and Why)

- Explicit election outcome prediction — requires richer historical and turnout data
- Geographic maps — too time-intensive for this MVP
- Real-time notifications — dashboard is analytical, not operational
