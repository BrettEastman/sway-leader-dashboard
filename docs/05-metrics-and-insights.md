This document maps each of the four core metrics to actionable insights and strategic decisions.

## 1. Sway Score

**Metric:** Total verified voters aligned with the leader

- Compare against other leaders for benchmarking (future feature)
- Set recruitment goals based on desired influence level

## 2. Electoral Influence by Jurisdiction / Race

**Metric:** Supporter counts grouped by jurisdiction and race

**Action:**

- Prioritize elections in high-concentration areas
- Time voter guides and mobilization efforts around upcoming elections
- Focus recruitment in jurisdictions where you're near meaningful thresholds

## 3. Growth Over Time

- Momentum vs stagnation
- Growth rate trends (accelerating, decelerating, or flat)
- Seasonal patterns in recruitment

**Action:**
