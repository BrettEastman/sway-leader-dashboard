# Leader Influence Dashboard — MVP Vision

This project is an example prototype Leader Influence Dashboard for Sway.co

Its purpose is to help a leader understand:

- Where their political influence is real and credible
- How that influence is changing over time
- Where focused growth could convert near-influence into decisive leverage

The dashboard prioritizes clarity, insight, and action over completeness. It is a blend of data storytelling and strategy — part analytics tool, part growth compass.

## Constraints

- Built as a 4–8 hour MVP
- Single leader context
- Read-only analytics experience
- Optimized for reasoning and decision-making, not polish

This prototype is intended to demonstrate product judgment, data modeling skill, and engineering clarity rather than feature breadth.
